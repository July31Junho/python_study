#NumPy Side Effects

#Subsetting NumPy Arrays

# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Store weight and height lists as numpy arrays
np_weight = np.array(weight)
np_height = np.array(height)

# Print out the weight at index 50
print(np_weight[50])

# Print out sub-array of np_height: index 100 up to and including index 110
print(np_height[100:111])


#2D NumPy Arrays


# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49,:])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight
np_weight = np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123,0])
